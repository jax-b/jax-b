As i mentioned in my previous post, I was planning on trying to print some artwork onto my the project. I have finally gotten around to it and it looks great.  
This is a simple project to pull off, Starting off i cut out a template on the laser cutter with a fiducial to help align the artwork on the printer. For the artwork i did a bit of work to make something unique.  
I went through and used a color mask on the artwork in order to separate out all of the gold bits so i could apply a different gloss to that section of the print making the gold parts shiny while the rest of the print was matte.
The effect was not very pronounced but I could still see it. You can use the carrousel to see the different pictures from the process. Underneath the carrousels you can see a timelapse of the printing process.
