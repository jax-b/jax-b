Apples AirTag is a neat piece of technology allowing for a user to easily locate their lost things. Except, for the small issue that its huge! At 8mm thick it cant fit easily in most wallets, causing a large uncomfortable bump. I tried several things to help mitigate that issue including designing a shell to help spread out the bump and printing someone else [credit card ring loop](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4843434). However that broke in a month, and I was stuck without a tracker.

A friend of mine sent me this video: I turned an AirTag into a card for wallets! by Andrew Ngai.

I was really excited with what I had seen in the video and I wanted to build my own with some twists. I had several things I wanted to change like integrating the speaker into the 3d print it self. I also didn't want to have Duck Tape anywhere in my design because after a while the glue of the Duck Tape will leak out of the sides and get onto everything in my wallet. 

So I finally got around to it. After several iterations of the case I got down to this.
