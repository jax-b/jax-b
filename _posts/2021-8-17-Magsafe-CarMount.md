Quite a few months back Apple announced their new iPhone 12, with a new charging standard called MagSafe. This new charging standard uses wireless charging and a ring of locating magnets. I bought the new phone and MagSafe Charger and I was excited to try it out. It had a surprising amount of holding power and I thought it would hold my phone well in the car. At the time there was no charging MagSafe car mount so I had to build one.

## Parts and Design

I used a [ProClip Mount](https://www.proclipusa.com/vehicle/dashboard-mounts/ford-escape/2020) and their [Heavy Duty Tilt-Swivel](https://www.proclipusa.com/product/tilt-swivel-mount-with-amps-face-plate-heavy) to create my mounting surface. ProClip uses the ALPS hole standard making it easy to design my holder. I have been using ProClip mounts for over a decade now and I have never had a problem with them. They have specialty plates for almost any car under the sun.

After I had the mount I modeled everything in Fusion360 and then quickly formed the mount. There is a recess in the face of the mount to hold a piece of [3M VHB Tape](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0016HM7SE/) in order to secure the MagSafe Charger in. The Fusion files for everything are [here](assets\3DFiles\Posts\2021\magsafecarmount\MagSafe_to_AMPS_adapter_v14.f3z).

## Assembly and Mounting
First came the ProClip mount onto the dash. This was followed by the heavy duty tilt swivel mount and the 3d printed mount, using [screws from ProClip](https://www.proclipusa.com/product/medium-self-tapping-screws-4-pack). Lastly the MagSafe charger was placed into the face. Cable management was done using another [ProClip product](https://www.proclipusa.com/product/scosche-cable-management-clips-2-pack).

## All Done
First off here is a case on the mount as well as a phone.

Secondly I have made this mount for both my dad and my brother in the slide show below you can see it in my car, my dad's car, and finally my brother's car.

I have been using this mount for over six months now and it has worked stupendously, aside from when I knock it off with my hand (that's more of a me issue). My phone has only fallen off once when I was going down a very bumpy road with pot holes. All in all a huge success! A nice feature that both me and my dad have is wired CarPlay but this mount makes it harder to use. Luckily, someone makes a [wired to wireless CarPlay adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P1GWQDB/).
